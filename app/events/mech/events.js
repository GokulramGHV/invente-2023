To make the event different from the conventional quiz contests, we have incorporated a mock simulation of the technical interview rounds which take place during campus placements. Round 2 consists of group discussion followed by interview in the third round. In addition to testing the core concepts of a participant, this particular event acts like a mock placement round which in turn facilitates the students to get exposed to the placement process. ',
